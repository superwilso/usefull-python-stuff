# usefull python stuff
 couple of usefull python applications that I made and use. For the best experience I recomend compiling into a EXE and placing a shortcut into startup folder.
 requires pystray, pillow, keyboard, pycaw, comtypes
 quick copy to help  pip install pystray pillow keyboard pycaw comtypes
